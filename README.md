## Purpose of this project
I wanted a website to act as a portfolio. 
I used this as an opportunity to learn Vue.js

## What I learnt in this project

**First Personal Project**
Since this was my first personal project, I was able to learn about creating the beginnings of a website

**Learning Vue**
This was my first project using Vue, so I learnt the basics.
- How to set up a Vue project 
- Using components in Vue
- Reading from json files in Vue
- Dynamic properties and the appropriate short-hand (i.e. `:src` instead of `v-bind:src`)
- Local data and emitting events

This was also my first personal project using bootstrap, I was able to learn:
- Navbars in bootstrap
- Cards
- Using general bootstrap layout helpers such as `my-5`, which adds a margin to the y-axis (top and bottom)
